\chapter{Analysis}

In this chapter, I will give a deeper analysis of the four
components of the search application identified in
chapter~\ref{intro} and start to highlight areas where linked data
approaches or semantic web technologies could have a r\^ole to play.

\input{chapter3.1}

\section{Search Results Page}

The default results page currently returned for a query breaks the individual
results into the zones or categories mentioned in section~\ref{content}. A
navigation menu on the left allows users to drill down into the results just
for that category.

\section{Editor's Choice}

Each and every link promoted within this feature is hand-chosen by editorial
staff and much manual effort is needed to keep promoting new concepts
as they appear and to remove pages as they get superseded. It is hoped
in this proposal we can reduce some of that manual curation through the use
of linked data and demonstrate ways editorial staff can focus on curating
their own linked data such that Editor's Choice could evolve into a more
generalised and automated subsystem. A metadata-driven curation system
could use common patterns in the data to promote orders of magnitude more
top links with a fraction of the current effort.
However, there would be a need to get a list of the known static pages
as they will not appear in the RSS/Atom feeds. Some integration with the
underlying CMS may be necessary or we would have to rely on web crawling
to find these pages.

\section{Search Suggest}

The list of suggestions that might surface in this system are
currently chosen and maintained by hand by editorial staff. If a new
concept breaks into the news (such as a notable person becoming notable
for the first time), then a person must enter that term into the system.
Similarly, if something should not be suggested to users any longer
(perhaps for legal reasons or simply because it is no longer a relevant
concept), then it must be amended or removed manually.

This manual maintenance of the suggestion list also leads to a
disconnect between searchable content and suggested queries that might
appear as users type. There is an onus on editorial staff to ensure
that content will be found when a suggested query is used. It might
serve the website users better to find mechanisms by which to generate
a useful set of suggestions from the corpus of content as it is
indexed. The heterogenous nature of BBC content turns this into
further integration work where different business rules are likely required
to generate suggestions from different types of content.
